1. For my project I will be creating a 'library' similar to the toy example that was provided. The main goal of this project is to have users answer questions, and based on their answers, recommend books for them to read. In order to make this more interactive for users, I am also planning on incorporating a GUI (graphic user interface) and then keeping all of the books inside a dictionary.
2a. The first function will be used to ask questions and receive answers from the user. 
2b. This second function is where a book will be determined based off of the user's answers. 
2c. This function will be used to display the book info.
2d. This last function is where the GUI set up will take place, but it will become integrated with the first function.
