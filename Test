The functionality of the program can be tested by participating in the questionnaire and then receiving a recommendation. Once the program is opened, a separate window will be opened where all of the questions will populate. Under each question, there will be a dropdown of options that the use can choose from. Once the user has answered all of the questions that they choose to, they can then click the "Go" button and a book will be recommended to them. If they are not happy with the book that they were given they can click the "Choose Another Book" button and they will receive a new recommendation. When a book is recommended, the title, author, a description, and the isbn will be given. The user will need to download the .csv file I will provide that contains all of the books and their information. (currently figuring out how to add the csv file to my project)
