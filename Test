The functionality of the program can be tested by participating in the questionnaire and then receiving a recommendation. Once the program is opened, a separate window
will be opened and the first question will appear. There will be multiple buttons underneath the question so that the user can choose an answer that best describes
them. Depending on the answer that the user chooses, it will take them to a different question, and this process will continue for a little bit. Depending on the answer
that is chosen, the user will be put on one specific path. In order to make sure that the entire program works correctly, the user could continue to answer the 
questions while providing a different answer each time. This would ensure that a different book is recommended each time.
